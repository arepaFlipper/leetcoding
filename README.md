Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving a LeetCode problem every day to improve coding skills and keep the algorithmic thinking sharp. Each problem's solution is provided mostly in Python and organized into separate directories for easy reference.

Directory Structure

    <id_problem>-<problem-name>/: Contains the solution and test cases for the problem.

Problem Solving Approach

I expect to follow a structured approach when solving problems, which includes:

    Problem Statement: A brief description of the problem.

    Solution: The code solution in Python.

    Explanation: A detailed explanation of the solution and its time and space complexity.

    Time Complexity: An analysis of the time complexity of the solution.

    Space Complexity: An analysis of the space complexity of the solution.

Running the Code

You can run the code by copying and pasting it into your Python environment or using an online Python IDE.

python

# Example for running a solution
python filename.py
